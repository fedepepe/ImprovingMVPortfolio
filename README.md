This code tests the basic idea of my Master thesis. I propose an improved estimator of the covariance matrix of asset returns, employed in the computation of the  minimum-variance portfolio. The main.py script tests the out-of-sample performance of this estimator, which is shown to deliver much better results than the sample covariance matrix and the equally-weighted portfolio
